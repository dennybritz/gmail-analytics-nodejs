On June 26, 2014 Google announced a new [Gmail API](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/). Among other things, the API allows developers to read messages, send mail, and manage labels.

This repository contains scripts to perform analytics on your own Gmail account. It is written in node.js because I've been wanting to learn node for a while. In order to run the scripts you must obtain credentials through the Google Developer Console. [Refer to the Gmail authentication guide for more details](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/auth/about-auth).
